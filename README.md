# Restaurants

A GIS application to help remember which restaurants to try throughout the Houston area. Each restaurant has a link to the restaurant's website and menu if appicable. The restaurants are color coded to easily determine if the I've eaten there or not. If I have eaten at the restaurant, then I gave it a rating out of five stars and attached pictures of what I ordered.
